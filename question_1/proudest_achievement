## My Proudest Achievement
My proudest achievement was creating an interactive timeline for the application I worked on at my previous job. The purpose of the application was to display geographic data over an interactive map interface. The timeline allowed a user to view how data in the application changed over time. Adding a timeline to the application was something my manager and our customers had been looking forward to. I iterated over several prototypes, using feedback to tweak the design with the goal of making the interface as intuitive as possible. Working on this project taught me how to be a more adaptable. I used a JavaScript library to provide the base functionality of the timeline, and at first this was convenient. However, As more requirements were added to the timeline, I had to learn how to leverage the library while working around its limitations. I developed a sense of ownership of the timeline and was excited to show new functionality at weekly meetings. My team was happy with the look and feel of the timeline and our manager reported positive feedback when demoing it to customers.
